# What does this crap do?
- Idk try it out yourself

# How does it work and how can i use it?
## Great question young one! So basically:
- Upon installment you need to create a folder within the same directory as the "main.py" file and name it "Docs"
- Start the app (if everything is set correctly; icon file is in the same directory as main.py and the folder "Docs")
- Use the app and do shit, it's pretty fun!

# Why did you make this?
## Shut up this took me, uhh, a day or something
